# Examples of when "clean" might be necessary
#	- Switching between two compilers (clang++ and g++). The .o files
#	produced by on compiler are not compatible with the other.
#	- After making significant changes to the interface (.h files) between
#	multiple parts of a program that uses separate compilation.
#	- If we are about to copy the files to another directory, or if we are
#	finished with a project and want to save disk space.

# Note: "make clean" almost always runs the clean rule unless there is a file
# that has the exact same name as the rule in the file.

# Clean
#	"/bin/rm" specifies what version of the rm program to use.
#	"-f" stands for "force" and to "do this even if there is a problem".
